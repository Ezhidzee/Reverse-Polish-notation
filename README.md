# OneLineCalculator
My one-line calculator project was written for the android project "converter &amp; calculator". I have used the reverse polish notation algorithm. You can learn more about the algorithm here: http://www.interface.ru/home.asp?artid=1492. The project is implemented in the Java language. The project is open source.
